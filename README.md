The backend is in flask, so you have to [figure out how to deploy that](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/deploying/index.html).

The frontend is in Elm, so you have to [figure out how to compile that](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html).
The result should be `frontend/index.html`.
